# Hubitat Private Applications Repository

This repository serves as a centralized location for my private Hubitat Elevation applications and integrations.

## Purpose

This repository is designed to:
- House custom Hubitat applications and device drivers
- Maintain version control for personal Hubitat automation projects
- Provide a structured approach to managing Hubitat package manifests
- Store documentation and configuration files for Hubitat integrations

## Repository Structure

- `packageManifest.json` - Package manifest file for Hubitat Package Manager integration
- `battery-monitor.groovy` - Enhanced Battery Monitor application
- Additional applications and drivers will be organized in dedicated folders

## Current Applications

- **Enhanced Battery Monitor** - Advanced battery monitoring application with configurable thresholds and intelligent notifications that sends alerts when devices cross battery level boundaries (high→medium→low)

## Installation

Applications in this repository can be installed via:
1. Hubitat Package Manager (HPM) using the package manifest
2. Manual installation by copying code directly to your Hubitat hub
3. Direct import using raw GitHub URLs

## Usage

Each application will include its own documentation with installation instructions, configuration details, and usage examples.
